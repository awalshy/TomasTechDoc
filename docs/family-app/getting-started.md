# Getting Started

This section will go through the installation of the project locally, and launching development mode.

First of all you need to have flutter installed. You can check if flutter is installed by running in a terminal instance `flutter doctor`. If flutter is not installed, please follow [these instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

## Download the project

First, go on the [repository page](https://github.com/awalshy/TomasFamilyApp), and download the repository or clone it.

##### Cloning with http

Run `git clone https://github.com/awalshy/TomasFamilyApp.git`

##### Cloning with ssh

Make sure that you added your ssh *public* key to your github account. Then run `git clone git@github.com:awalshy/TomasFamilyApp.git`

## Install the project's dependencies

Move into the project folder (Run `cd TomasFamilyApp`), then run the flutter command `flutter pub get`. It will automatically get the dependencies and link them for android and iOS.



Well done ! Lets start coding.
